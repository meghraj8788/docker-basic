#Dcoker Compose
1 - this is best like while creating image and container everytime you need to build image and run container if 2 container two times need to run build and run command
2 - to do automation of this we used compose file which is in yaml format where we pass value as key:pair type
33 - it will create all thing we do not need to run command one thing we need to do is
4 - docker-compose up --build -d ---> this we run this compose file and compose file will do all thing for you to create image to build container to run on ports

so version is docker compose version need to use

service is image name their we can pass as we have two image python and java that name here we used
build --> here we pass docker file path for that image
ports: ---> as we use flask in python need 5000 port we are enable this
networks: ----> we create my-network so we can run 2 container on that so we use networks for that

in below we use another image which i s java
depends_on: ---> java is depends on python some time docker can create java image and container first before pythhon image and container this can give issue so depends_on if we use it will                    crete and build container after python container
below we mentioned netwrok details
this is how compose file will do all this we just need to run compose file command which is
- > docker-compose up --build -d
-> docker-compose down --> will stop everythin which run from compose
